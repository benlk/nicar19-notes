I visited the freelancers roundtable.

How do freelancers get paid?
: very slowly

Paid for submitting or paid for publishing?
: Depends on contract.

How do I figure whether an estimate is too much or too little? How do I not blow my estimate?
: I've never had someone back out because I asked for too much money.
: Some journalist unions may have suggested rate sheets, or collect records of hourly fees. http://www.londonfreelance.org/rates/index.php is one such collection.
: The Writer's Market has pricing estimates.
: Be very specific about your scope.
: $50/hour is standard.
: The Pulitzer Center, the Type Center, and FIRE, and Fund for investigative journalism.
: One writer has different tiers of rates based on process: preliminary reasearch (tier 1), research (tier 2), calling up new sources and writing and applying for grants (tier 3) 

How do you identify yourself?
: I write for <publication recently written for>
: I'm a reporter working on a story,
: You can google me; I'm a legit reporter.

Is it ethical to have a relationship with a source who wants to pay you to do things? Like, could a private spy agency pay my flight to a locaiton that I was interested in covering, if I wrote for them as well as for my original source?
: Become an author who is represented by an agent. You're allowed and encouraged to help your sources. As long as you disclose your relationship in the *book* that you publish, no one cares. But I can no longer work for all these publications. It's impossible to go back.
: There's middle ground; it depends on what your clients are willing to accept.
: You have to make the choice for yourself if you want to accept gifts from sources.
: There's a distinction between ethics for work done for internal eyes and published publicly. If you're doing journalism for an internal publication (corporate clients) that is okay with you accepting flights/lodging/food from a source, that's different from freelancing for the NYT.

Do you have your own libel insurance?
: Check with your outlet; some do indemnify you.
: Check with your homeowner's insurance.

Do you keep track of your time?
: Only if I'm getting paid hourly.
: Loosely. I'm aware that I'm starting the day at this time and ending at another time. But sometimes I would bill for fewer hours than I actually worked, so I wanted to bill them for the hours I actually worked on the project.

Do you bill for the time you self-educate?
: I do.
: I don't, because they pay me for knowing how to do something.

How do you make it easier for people to fact-check?
: Using Scrivener to cross-reference the text and the transcripts and sources
: Footnotes!
: Evernote

How do you integrate with the team?
: Well, you should have the editor's contacts.
: Some clients would place you in your newsroom.
