### Propublica's crowdsourcing talk

They're soon releasing a set of forms and processes and software, based off of their Documenting Hate project. 

A tip form feeds the database. Database feeds the reporter. Reporter writes the story.

It's a django app.


Examples of other crowsourced data tools:

- Reveal's rehab reporting network
- Crosscheck
- Vox hospital bills
- Compprova
- verficad

Do you want to crowd-power your data project?

- What's the question you want to answer?
- Can this question be answered by surveying the public?
- Do you need to file records requests or find existing data sets?
- Is your reporting priority quantitative or qualitative?
- What audience do you need to reach?

Building your form
- Keep it simple enough that people can submit it. You can accomplish collecting a lot of data with a simple multiline textbox. 

If you have a specific tip form, also have a general tip form, linked from the specific tip form. "This is the form for X. If you have other tips, try this form."
