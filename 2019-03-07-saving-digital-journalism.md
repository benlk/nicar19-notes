Katherine Boss is part of a team (Meredith Broussard, Fernando Chirigati, R&eacute; Rampin, Vicky Steeves) at NYU that is building an emulation-based web archiving tool. It takes a lot of time to convert dynamic sites to static sites, and that isn't scalable if you aren't building the original sites yourself. 

News apps differ from other born-digital news content in that they're often interactive, depending on external servers or libraries or data sources. Each one is custom software. And, frequently, they're dependent upon specific versions of specific browsers or specific software plugins like Flash or Unity or VRML or WebGL.

Working with Rhizome, they've developed a library of emulated browsers. 

Are we okay if AWS S3 is still around in 20 years? Not really. Will your organization still be playing your hosting bill? Librarians are thinking more than 20 years into the future. Journalism is the bread and butter of historical record; libraries are working on ways to store it for hundreds of years.

Docker is not a way of saving your stuff; it's 6 years old and there's no guarantee that your proprietary software will work in even 5 years. Docker itself isn't stable!

NYU Libararies and the NYU Center for Data Science are extending ReproZip to capture a bunch of data. reprozip.org and examples.reprozip.org. But it still has to be run on the production server, a linux machine.

What's the economic model for this? Well, newsrooms monetize their archives by selling it to libraries. 

Scandanavian libraries have a mandatory-deposit law, where to get copyright in a thing you need to give a copy of it to libraries.
