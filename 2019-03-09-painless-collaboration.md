### Generally painless collaboration within the newsroom panel

See the slides at TKTK

Tips for the data team/person:
- Hold brown-bag sessions explaining what you're capable of. Start from the beginning, explain the project. You'll get a lot of reactions off the bat, but the harder part is getting people to keep coming back to you.
- Manage expectations. How will you handle people who ask you to do something that you don't do.
- You have to stand behind your data; a good editor comes in handy to make sure the written word is backed by the data.
- Ways to convince colleagues to invest more time:
	- Build an inspiratino folder and new tech inspirments folder.
	- Make the chart, find an example for the project for the project you want to create.
	- Create a functional prorotype.
	- Being prepared is key in getting your idea across.
- Be approachable
	- Have office hours! Set aside time where people can come talk to you about data.
	- Invite reporters to your team meetings.
