This conversations track meeting is about doing data journalism in smaller areas. Bits of advice:

- When your legislature is out of session, use that freed-up time to train yourself in tools that will help you save time during the legislative session.
- It's okay to make even small graphs and charts and suchlike. Start small to prove that you can do the thing.
- If the city or county won't give you data, go to the state and ask for that data.
- Know the law, but don't use it to bully the records officer. See if your state AG has a guidesheet for the state of Freedom of Information law. Be friends with past litigants (or their lawyers) in your state, who will know the effects.
- "They're not giving us the data they're obliged to give us" is a story that sometimes you have to publish.
- "I don't knwo what button to push" or "I havne't been trained" is okay; you can work with those people and train them to give you the data you want in the format you need.
- "I don't know you" or "This is a small town" or "This is a boy's club town and you're not in the club" is an obstacle that can be overcome by explaining the benefit of doing this.
- "I'm training people to give me records" &mdash; Erin Mansfield. She requests data so frequently that they've started disclosing the data proactively.
- "You're from out of state; you'll be gone in a few months; I can ignore you" is overcome by sticking around.
- You can work with other news orgs to share the data and localize it.
- Find the nerd in the basement, or the GIS department, and speak their language, and they'll be happy to give you the data.

Ways to get editorial buy-in:

- Block off time on your calendar to do data work.
- Show your editors how much you love being given spreadsheets.
- Talk about the added value that a given data-driven piece of reporting will add to the general reporting.
- Work with other parts of your newsroom to make the stuff look better. An example given was pairing up with the in-house ad creation team to improve graphics.

Top desires:
- Time to work on things
- Access to records
- Assistance on data wrangling
