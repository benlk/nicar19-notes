Only 17% of newsrooms respond to the ASNE newsroom diversity survey. Why might that be? Responses from the audience:

- Not tracking the data internally that would bee needed to respond to the survey.
- Not wanting to be persecuted for a response that is seen as lacking.

Other notes:
- Being the first person in a team who is different, who is a minority, who isn't represented on the team is so hard, compared to being the second person who doesn't fit.
- Create a norm of pushing back on injustice.
- Sometimes you have to take a chance on people.
- Persistence in jobseeking usually carries forward to persistence in the job.
- If you're the first person, be visible, so that others may feel comfortable joining.
- You can learn about different communities; you can research this topic the same as any other beat.
- Use what you have.

Questions:
- Do we want to better represent our audiences?
- Do we want to tell our audience's stories?

The three Rs:
- Recruiting: Hire diversely
- Rising: Promote diversely
- Retention: Retain the people you hire and promote

On "Bridging": The diverse people you hire may bring a connection to a community, but if that person that leaves the organization, the org will want to retain the connections they bring. Don't rely on a single person to connect you to a community; use they connection they bring to forge a larger connection between the community and many people within your org and between the community and your org.

Make sure your hiring team is diverse, because otherwise you may not realize that X qualification that you, personally, have not heard of is in fact a really big thing in another community.

Diversity requires vigilance! It's easy for hiring committees to skew in a less-diverse direction.

"Journalists of color don't stay" is not a reflection upon the journalists who leave, but on your organization. Why aren't they staying? Exit interviews if you can, but figure out what you need to change.

Don't be afraid to examine your own perspectives. It's okay for reporting in your newsroom to not reflect your perspective; look at how cable news has diverse commentators.

Is there a pipeline to hire your Diversity Fellow before their fellowship is up?

Online-only news sites are slightly better at diversity than legacy news media.

"If you don't meet these exact requirements in a job listing, please apply anyways." is a big way to encourage people to apply who might not have traditional credentials.
