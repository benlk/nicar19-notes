### Building your own databases

This session's lessons are drawn from a cross-newsroom collaboration.

Tools to get the DB started:

- Google Forms is a simple way to create a list of questions that people can enter in responses. Free and browser-based.
- Dropbox is a single place to store files, but that's not free.
- Open Semantic was used to ingest documents from Dropbox, index, and search. Want an alternative? Try https://www.overviewdocs.com/
- Use Amazon Mechanical Turk humans to do data grunt work. ProPublica has a guide to using MTurk.
- Airtable has a way to restrict users' ability to edit certain things.

Before you start:
- Don't just start typing the story.
- Figure out what your process will be for tracking requests, cleaning and consolidating data. Do that before requesting data.
- Test your process for a small sample of docs, before going for full automation of requests.
- Figure out whether you're collecting the data that will help you reach the finding that you want to reach at the end of the story. Figure out what data you need from requested docs to answer your question. Test that the docs actually contain that data. Review your database fields.
- Have someone that the whole team can consult who can locate things/info quickly, who's in charge of managing the project files, who can be asked.  A file wrangler.
- Have a dedicated slack/chat channel for the database project. Have periodic status meetings.
- How do you validate data? Make guidelines and write them down. Incorporate that into the forms.
- When someone asks a question, give that answer to the entire team, not just the person who asked.
- Keep "would screw a source"-type docs off the internet, off the intranet. Develop table names for that data.
