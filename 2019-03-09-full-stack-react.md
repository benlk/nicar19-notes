### Full-stack React

https://github.com/TylerFisher/full-stack-react

This was a hands-on course. Some thoughts:

- HTML is output by React running in the browser, which draws data from the Redux ORM running in the browser, which requests data from the server's API. The server runs whatever backend database you want.

But now I wonder: Is there guidance on profiling your readership's useragents to determine what sorts of interactives would be performant on their devices? Does it make sense to load massive JS apps on phones?
