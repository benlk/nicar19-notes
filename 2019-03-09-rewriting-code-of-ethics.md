### Rewriting the code of ethics: New standards for digital journalism

The decision-making process in right now don't involve the people who use the tech or whose data is processed using the tech. UC Berkeley is looking for proposals to reform established ethics, through lobbying and standards-setting.

TKTK: link to the questions handout.

Personal notes:
- Internet archives and screenshots are like already-printed books and xeroxes. There's no practical way to retract or correct them. 
- Better to amend the published article than to write a follow-up without amending. Make a dedicated category.tag for tracking corrections, and use that to link to the original URL.
- Are any news sites using the addition/deletion HTML tags to mark up stories that are heavily edited?
- The Minor Edits plugin may be useful. Or a site that pushes to Internet Archive, then 

My questions/observations on modern ethics.

- Can reporters be pseudonymous to protect themselves?
- How ephemeral can we be? What are the document/info/source retention rules?
- Should we include the government as a source of harm in our consideration of harm reduction?
- To blur faces or not to blur faces? Is it allowed to minimize harm?
- Can we refer to someone by established handles? Or is it necessary to refer to someone by their legal name?
- Is it permissible to link different facets of a sharded identity? Can we link a person's identity in different social circles ethically? If we can't out someone ourselves, can someone use us to out themself?
- What is the difference between being seen and identified?
- What does "Privacy" mean? Private from whom?
- We're unprepared to handle the intersection of immutable publishing (blockchain, IPFS) and corrections and takedown notices.
- "This story has been updated" is insufficient on its own (How? When? By whom? Why?); how can updates be better described?
- Do CMSes capture correction/revision logs? Should we expose that to readers in its entirety or at all?
- What if people have an expectation of privacy in public spaces.
- Photo waivers are tough to obtain for crowd shots.
- Journalism is unprepared to handle _legal_ requirements to forget factual history.
- All reporting causes harm. What harm is allowable?
