Google doc that encompasses the talk: TKTK

The takeaway from this talk is that the data is out there for you to investigate, but it's often incmplete or miscategorized. Interview your data, and cross-check the data against the people the data is about.

Make your workflows reproducible, link to the data you use, and include a "nerd box" in your stories explaining the methodologies you use and linking to the data and workflows so that other people can examine how you reached the conclusions. https://twitter.com/rachelwalexande/status/1104092032241287168
